Welcome to MetaBinner's documentation!
======================================

MetaBinner is an application for catagorizing organisms from 
a sequenced environmental sample, regardless of the sequencing method.
The input to the application is an alignment file, as specified below.
The output is an XML file with reads mapped to proteins, and thus, to
organisms.
